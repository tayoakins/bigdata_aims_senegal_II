!!! VERY IMPORTANT !!!
This is the first serie of lecture I gave on Machine Learning and it is not perfect.
Feel free to comment and criticize such that I can improve it!
Thank you!


In the present folder you can find slides, ipython notebooks and other resource materials introduced during the "Big Data II" lecture given at AIMS Senegal in January 2016.

The course is strongly inspired by the following books and websites :

- http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html
- http://www.astroml.org/sklearn_tutorial/
- "Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning" by D. Barber
- "Introduction to Machine Learning - 2nd Edition" by E. Alpaydin
- "Introduction to Machine Learning" by A. Smola and S.V.N Vishwanathan
